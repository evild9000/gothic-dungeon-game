# Background Image Specifications

## Required Background Images

To complete the dynamic background system, you'll need to provide the following image files in the `images/backgrounds/` directory:

### **Image Specifications:**
- **Format:** JPG or PNG (JPG recommended for smaller file sizes)
- **Dimensions:** 1920x1080 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio) - will scale responsively
- **File Size:** Keep under 500KB each for optimal loading performance
- **Style:** Fantasy/medieval theme matching your gothic Diablo-style aesthetic

### **Image Optimization Guide:**

#### **Method 1: JPG Compression (Recommended)**
- **Format:** Use JPG for photographic/realistic backgrounds
- **Quality Setting:** 75-85% quality (sweet spot for size vs quality)
- **Tools:** 
  - **Photoshop:** File > Export > Export As > JPG (Quality: 8-9/12)
  - **GIMP:** File > Export As > JPG (Quality: 75-85)
  - **Online:** TinyJPG.com, Squoosh.app, or Compressor.io
- **Expected Size:** 200-400KB at 1920x1080

#### **Method 2: PNG with Optimization**
- **Format:** Use PNG only for images with transparency or very few colors
- **Tools:** 
  - **TinyPNG.com** (reduces PNG size by 50-70%)
  - **Photoshop:** File > Export > Export As > PNG (Smaller File)
  - **OptiPNG** or **PNGCrush** command line tools
- **Expected Size:** 300-500KB at 1920x1080

#### **Method 3: WebP Format (Modern Alternative)**
- **Format:** WebP offers 25-35% better compression than JPG
- **Quality Setting:** 80-90% quality
- **Tools:** 
  - **Squoosh.app** (Google's online tool)
  - **Photoshop 2021+** with WebP plugin
  - **Convertio.co** for batch conversion
- **Expected Size:** 150-300KB at 1920x1080
- **Note:** Update file extensions in code from `.jpg` to `.webp`

#### **Pro Tips for Size Reduction:**

1. **Optimize Image Content:**
   - Use darker backgrounds (compress better)
   - Avoid high-contrast details in large areas
   - Reduce noise/grain in source images

2. **Smart Composition:**
   - Focus detail in center, blur edges slightly
   - Use gradients instead of complex textures where possible
   - Limit color palette (especially for dungeons)

3. **Batch Processing:**
   - Use **ImageOptim** (Mac) or **FileOptimizer** (Windows)
   - **Adobe Bridge** batch processing
   - **XnConvert** for bulk optimization

4. **Progressive JPG:**
   - Enable progressive encoding for smoother loading
   - Photoshop: Save for Web > Progressive checkbox

### **Required Images:**

#### 1. **Village Background**
- **Filename:** `village.jpg`
- **Description:** Pleasant medieval village scene with buildings, paths, maybe some NPCs in the background
- **Mood:** Welcoming, safe, civilized
- **Suggested Elements:** Stone buildings, cobblestone paths, market stalls, warm lighting

#### 2. **Dungeon Backgrounds (5 variations)**
- **Filenames:** 
  - `dungeon1.jpg` - Dark stone corridors
  - `dungeon2.jpg` - Cave/cavern setting
  - `dungeon3.jpg` - Underground tomb/crypt
  - `dungeon4.jpg` - Volcanic/lava dungeon
  - `dungeon5.jpg` - Ice/frozen dungeon
- **Description:** Dark, dangerous underground environments
- **Mood:** Threatening, mysterious, claustrophobic
- **Suggested Elements:** Stone walls, torches, shadows, architectural details

#### 3. **Shop Background**
- **Filename:** `shop.jpg`
- **Description:** Medieval merchant's shop interior
- **Mood:** Busy, commercial, well-stocked
- **Suggested Elements:** Shelves with goods, counters, warm lighting, merchant tools

#### 4. **Crafting Background**
- **Filename:** `crafting.jpg`
- **Description:** Blacksmith forge or craftsman's workshop
- **Mood:** Industrial, fiery, productive
- **Suggested Elements:** Forge fire, anvil, tools, hot metals, sparks

#### 5. **Recruitment Background**
- **Filename:** `recruitment.jpg`
- **Description:** Training grounds or military camp
- **Mood:** Organized, martial, preparatory
- **Suggested Elements:** Training dummies, weapon racks, banners, open fields

### **Implementation Notes:**

1. **Fallback Handling:** If images are missing, the system will gracefully fall back to CSS gradients
2. **Performance:** Images are loaded on-demand when backgrounds change
3. **Responsive:** Images will scale to fit different screen sizes while maintaining aspect ratio
4. **Smooth Transitions:** 1-second fade transition between different backgrounds

### **Testing:**
Place sample images in the backgrounds folder and test the system by:
1. Starting the game (should show village background)
2. Entering dungeon (should show random dungeon background)
3. Opening shop/crafting/recruitment (should show respective backgrounds)
4. Exiting back to village (should return to village background)

### **File Size Verification:**
- **Windows:** Right-click file > Properties > Size
- **Mac:** Get Info > Size
- **Online:** Upload to TinyJPG.com to see current and optimized sizes
- **Target:** All files should be under 500KB (512,000 bytes)

### **Quick Size Reduction Checklist:**
âœ… **Start with 1920x1080 source image**
âœ… **Export as JPG with 75-85% quality**
âœ… **Run through TinyJPG.com or similar optimizer**
âœ… **Verify file size is under 500KB**
âœ… **Test image quality in browser**
âœ… **Adjust quality if needed (lower = smaller file)**

### **Alternative Approach - Smaller Base Resolution:**
If 500KB is still difficult to achieve:
- **Create at 1600x900** then upscale with CSS (90% of quality, 70% of file size)
- **Create at 1280x720** then upscale with CSS (80% of quality, 50% of file size)
- Browser scaling will handle the upscaling smoothly

### **ðŸ”„ Easy JPG to WebP Conversion:**

- Include animated elements (can be achieved with CSS animations over static images)
- Add weather effects (rain, snow overlays)

The system is designed to be easily expandable - just add more images to the backgrounds folder and update the background arrays in the code as needed.
