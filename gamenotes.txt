future todo:
- mobile screen layout and background images - maybe some tweaks yet
- move some small chunks out of gamecontroller to other controllers
- allow to sell items in shop?
=============
underling inventory: revamp because it doesnt show items equipped-- move the equipment slot graphics and equipment management for underlings to the inventory module and remove it from the character management 

--

test- warrior shield bash stun isnt causing the foe to lose their turn, they get a chance to resist based on will/con 'save'
test -give some little icons near the  name for status effects, such as stunned, webbed, poisoned, burning, etc review all spells, abilities, powers and if there is an ongoing status effect positive or negative give an icon for it to the 	affected target with a hover over tooltip showing rounds remaining of the effect and information about it.

here are the latest list of bugs, issues and feature requests:  - healing light only allowed targeting the hero not all allies
- casting a spell by the hero should count as its turn and then proceed to the next entity, not allow me to keep casting spells or attack as well
- protective shield only allowed me to cast on warrior underling not other allies or self
- i want silk armor to include a small mana bonus for each piece - obviously calculate this into the wearers max mana
- healer should not use healing abilities unless someone is at 60% health or less
- when using an item such as a stamina or mana potion, when the modal comes up to select the target, show their mana and stamina as well as their health
- when the party exits a dungeon the message says they recover 15% HP/SP - change it to say HP/Mana and stamina


test - all spells, abilities
- summons
