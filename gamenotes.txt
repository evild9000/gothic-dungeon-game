future todo:
- mobile screen layout and background images - maybe some tweaks yet
- move some small chunks out of gamecontroller to other controllers
- allow to sell items in shop?
- expand -give some little icons near the  name for status effects, such as stunned, webbed, poisoned, burning, etc review all spells, abilities, powers and if there is an ongoing status effect positive or negative give an icon for it to 2. the affected target with a hover over tooltip showing rounds remaining of the effect and information about it.

=============
submitted: 
1. ogre brute power - include in the combat if enemy was able to resist or not, if it was knocked down make sure it is losing its turn, and apply a debuff icon to its entity
2. ogre brute power - the power wasnt usable in the next combat after using it once in a prior combat
3. a combat should start with ROUND 1 in the log, and a round should advance even when the hero uses a power, it seems like the round indicator is not always advancing, its seems maybe like it is attached only to attacking possibly.
4. i had a skirmister equip a bow and then it attempted to equip a staff, and then instead of unequipping the other item first and 'swapping' them it simply overwrote the bow and the bow disappeared entirely and was gone. it should not delete the item.  the staff was equipped successfully.
5. when encountering other special things within the dungeon such as for example a hidden treasure cache (perhaps provide a fun gif or graphic appearing on the screen for this) then also supply the pop up modal to explore the dungeon further or exit, etc that you would normally offer, as at that point the only option is to exit the dungeon.
6. change the mechanics of dungeon encounters to be run by an overall encounter manager so that when entering the dungeon from the village or chosing 'go deeper' or 'explore this level' the encounter manager decides if the party encounters another battle, a puzzle, a trap or some other special event.  you may already have some of this in place, but this needs to be more consistent from all three of these button choices as well as a funnel point back from any one of these after encountering a trap, puzzle, or other mystery etc.  please get this organized.  
7. remove the riddles from puzzles
8. 'i notice something 'suspicious ahead' doesnt do anything, i do not see a trap interface loaded, is there some modal that is supposed to load?  perhaps this needs to be coded
9. reduce xp by 20% and increase gold by 20%
10. i wasnt able to make the bone armor, the crafting area said it only needed 2 bones per slot, but i also recall i wanted it to require the droppable loot called 'bone armor'  make sure this is listed as well.



test - magic button didnt work as troll
test - im not seeing underlings using racial powers, are they hooked up?
requested -rock throwing should just do damage at +ATK, not affect next attack

test puzzles, traps and all powers, abilities, racial powers, 


expand options to do in dungeon: 
puzzles, traps, mysteries, rituals, magical pools, etc, genies, wandering tinkerers, nodes

furthermore lets add some special abilities to all races and subraces, these abilities are usable at level 1 and scale in power as the person levels up here are the powers:
dwarf:	Ability: Stone Bulwark (grants power to add 10 to defense for 5 rounds)
elf: Ability: Meditate (grants power to regain 20 mana and 20 stamina)
gnome: Ability: Tinkering (grants power to summon clockwork device which is a scaling summonable creature that can attack foes, lasting only for the battle before dissassembling, usable only once per battle before the power is disabled - code this mechanic)
orc: Ability: Ferocity (if reduced to 0 or less hit points, reset to 10 hit points - code this - can use once per battle only)
giant:  Ability: Rock Throwing (hurl rock that does a large amount of damage ATK +15 but at the cost of 30 STA)
ogre: Ability: Brute (knock down up to three foes who receive a resistance check. base chance of success is 90% - 5% for each point of strength the opponent has, foes knocked down lose a turn, code this and the debuff icon)
troll: Ability: Regenerate  (always on, trolls regenerate 5% of their hit points every round in combat, code this)
yeti: Ability: Frost Breath (area of effect that targets up to 4 enemies for scaling damage)
