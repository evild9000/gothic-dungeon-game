future todo:
- mobile screen layout and background images - maybe some tweaks yet
- move some small chunks out of gamecontroller to other controllers
- allow to sell items in shop?
- expand -give some little icons near the  name for status effects, such as stunned, webbed, poisoned, burning, etc review all spells, abilities, powers and if there is an ongoing status effect positive or negative give an icon for it to 2. the affected target with a hover over tooltip showing rounds remaining of the effect and information about it.

=============

issues:
fix requested 1. hero is listed as having 0 stamina in 
fix requested 2. level lock hero abilities, ice shard 1, protective shield 2 healing light 3, lightning bolt 4, fire ball 5, healing circle 6
requested     3. resting should remove all effects such as stunned, poisoned, etc
requested     4. increase potential size of enemy group max size equals dungeon level, minimum of three
requested     5. add more monsters, add more drops
requested     6. add more crafting 
requested?    7. add more items
requested     8.  add monster logical groupings and level based monsters


resting or leaving the dungeon should remove all status effects from spells or buffs or debuffs, like bleeding, poison, burning, etc 2. the maximum size of the enemy group can increase to the level of the dungeon with a maximum of 3 at level 1 or 2 still, but for example a level 4 dungeon encounter could have up to 4 enemies or a level 7 dungeon encounter could have up to 7 enemies, howevre it is still random, but would be skewed towards a larger group the deeper the party went. 3. also add another 50 monster types of varying levels, keep some monsters types for deeper dungeon levels, so you may need to add a mechanic for monsters to only appear in the deeper levels of dungeons. 4. add a mechanic to group certain monsters together. dont just throw monsters together randomly. skeletons should not just appear with spiders. skeletons should appear with other undead like zombies or a a necromancer or something, wolves would only appear with goblin wolf riders or a orc beastmaster etc. add some logic to the monster grouping. you can even make some subtypes, like goblin shamans, orc warchiefs. get creative! and feel free to give the monsters special abilities because the framework is there 5. as you add the new monsters be sure to populate what sort of special loot they may drop for crafting, either creating new loot or allowing them to drop loot that wwe have. but keep in might we have slots that are not used yet, so we need craftable loot drops for rings, cloaks, necks, offhand items etc, again...get creative!


expand options to do in dungeon: 
puzzles, traps, mysteries, rituals, magical pools, etc, genies, wandering tinkerers, nodes
