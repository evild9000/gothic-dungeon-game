future todo:
- mobile screen layout and background images - maybe some tweaks yet
- move some small chunks out of gamecontroller to other controllers
- allow to sell items in shop?
- expand -give some little icons near the  name for status effects, such as stunned, webbed, poisoned, burning, etc review all spells, abilities, powers and if there is an ongoing status effect positive or negative give an icon for it to 2. the affected target with a hover over tooltip showing rounds remaining of the effect and information about it.

=============
submitted: 
1. i had a skirmister equip an item and then equipped another item, and then instead of unequipping the other item first and 'swapping' them it simply overwrote the bow and the bow disappeared entirely and was gone. it should not delete the item.  change the mechanics so that before it equips the new items it will automaticall unequip the old item first and return it to inventory BEFORE equipping the new item.
2. remove all of the riddles from puzzles modal
probably still screwed up - 3. bone armor now shows an unknown ingredient says undefined, is this due to recipe being unknown or a bug, it should show bone armor and 2 bones required right>?
4. the hero's modified hp, mana, stamina, etc should be immediately refectled and set to new max after racial species bonuses applied after creation and shown correctly in character management
5. when i do 'explore this level' from the 'whats next' modal, and combat ensues, the modal doesnt disappear, it should close if combat spawns.
6. giant rock throwing - i am still not offered a target drop down list, cant you make it coded like like ice shard
7. when i chose manual control of underlings, i cannot choose their action unless i chose attack with my hero, if i chose Powers, then the underling auto attacks
8. underling spells, skills and powers for class and species need to be available as buttons under choose action under manual mode, add this button and all pertinent powers along with necessary targetting dropdowns



test puzzles, traps and all powers, abilities, racial powers, 


expand options to do in dungeon: 
puzzles, traps, mysteries, rituals, magical pools, etc, genies, wandering tinkerers, nodes
====
lets move a base stat system where everyone has base stats of 5 and you receive bonuses from both class and species.  hp, mana, stamina, atk, def, etc all start at base for the class, but should still be modified up or down by species stats or gear
convert the set class stats to bonuses in the following manner:  
1. warriors receive +3 str, -1 dex, +3 con, -1 int, +1 wil
2. skirmishers receive -1 str, +3 dex, +1 int, +1 con, +1 wil
3. mages receive -2 str, +2 dex, -1 con, +3 int, +3 wil
4. priest receive -2 str, +1 con, +2 int, +4 wil

also convert the species select and application of stats from that choice to a bonus based system applying bonuses to the class template

add species (stat and slot variability)
- elf str -1 dex +2 con -1 int +1 wil +1 siz -1
- dwarf str +1 dex -1 con +2 wil +1 siz -1
- gnome str -2  dex +2  int +1 wil +1 siz -2
- orc  str +2 int -1 con +1 siz +1
- goblin str -1 dex +2 int -1 con +1 siz -1
- giantkin
	ogre  str +4 dex -1 con +2 int -2 wil -1 siz +4
	troll str +3 con +3 int -2 wil -2 siz +4
	giant str +7 dex -2 con +5 int -1 wil -1 siz +5
- yeti str +3 dex -1 con +1 int -1 wil +1 siz +1

- beastling (see the following for subspecies info)
	bull str +3 dex -1 con +2 int -1 wil +1 siz +2  (racial power: Charge, ability: knockdown works same as ogre brute power)
	bear str +2 dex -1 con +2 int -1 wil +2 siz +2  (racial power: Claw Slash, ability: two high ATK attacks that apply bleed)
	snake dex +2 wil +2  (racial power: Venemous Bite, ability that does damage and applies a high damage poison DOT to the target)
	tiger str +1 dex +2 siz +1 (racial power: Claw Slash, ability: two high ATK attacks that apply bleed)
	rat  str -2 dex +4 int -1 wil -1 siz -2 (racial power: Dodge ability: passive dodge power, when attacked has a 25% chance to avoid a hit outright, will require special code)
	wolf dex +1 con +1 wil +1 (racial power: Howl, ability: will cause fear and panic in non undead, affects all foes, targets get a willpower saving throw to resist otherwise lose a round, will require special code)
	spider str -1 dex +3 con -1 int +1 wil +1 siz -2  (racial powers: Web and Poison Bite abilties: same as the spider monster gets) also  (spider subspecies get special equipment slots: 8 legs, 4 hands, 4 feet, no arms, no cloak)
- plantfolk dex -2 con +3 wil +3 siz +2  (racial power:  Spores, ability, targets all enemies, does small damage over time to all and has a resistable stun effect based on con as the resistant effect.  undead are immune to the damage and stun, this will need coding)
- planar
	-elemental fire
	-elemental earth
	-elemental water
	-elemental air
	-demonic
	-angelic
	-cthonic
- fae
- undead

furthermore lets add some special abilities to all races and subraces, these abilities are usable at level 1 and scale in power as the person levels up here are the powers:
dwarf:	Ability: Stone Bulwark (grants power to add 10 to defense for 5 rounds)
elf: Ability: Meditate (grants power to regain 20 mana and 20 stamina)
gnome: Ability: Tinkering (grants power to summon clockwork device which is a scaling summonable creature that can attack foes, lasting only for the battle before dissassembling, usable only once per battle before the power is disabled - code this mechanic)
orc: Ability: Ferocity (if reduced to 0 or less hit points, reset to 10 hit points - code this - can use once per battle only)
giant:  Ability: Rock Throwing (hurl rock that does a large amount of damage ATK +15 but at the cost of 30 STA)
ogre: Ability: Brute (knock down up to three foes who receive a resistance check. base chance of success is 90% - 5% for each point of strength the opponent has, foes knocked down lose a turn, code this and the debuff icon)
troll: Ability: Regenerate  (always on, trolls regenerate 5% of their hit points every round in combat, code this)
yeti: Ability: Frost Breath (area of effect that targets up to 4 enemies for scaling damage)
