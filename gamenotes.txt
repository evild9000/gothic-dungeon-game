gnome: Ability: Tinkering (grants power to summon clockwork device which is a scaling summonable creature that can attack foes, lasting only for the battle before dissassembling, usable only once per battle before the power is disabled - code this mechanic)
orc: Ability: Ferocity (if reduced to 0 or less hit points, reset to 10 hit points - code this - can use once per battle only)
